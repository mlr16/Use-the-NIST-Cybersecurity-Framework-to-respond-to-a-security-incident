# Applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) consists of five core functions: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover**. These functions help organizations manage cybersecurity risks, implement risk management strategies, and learn from previous incidents. 

## The Five Core Functions

| Function  | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Identify**  | Manage security risks through audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential security gaps. |
| **Protect**   | Develop a strategy to safeguard internal assets by implementing policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate cybersecurity threats. |
| **Detect**    | Enhance monitoring capabilities to scan for potential security incidents and improve detection efficiency. |
| **Respond**   | Utilize proper procedures to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents while implementing process improvements. |
| **Recover**   | Restore affected systems and recover compromised data to resume normal operations. |

## Key Considerations for Each Core Function

### **1. Identify**
_Create an inventory of organizational systems, processes, assets, data, people, and capabilities that need security._

- **Technology/Asset Management**: Identify affected hardware, operating systems, and software.
- **Process/Business Environment**: Assess which business processes were impacted.
- **People**: Determine access requirements for affected systems.

### **2. Protect**
_Develop and implement safeguards to ensure the security of identified assets._

- **Access Control**: Who requires access? How can unauthorized access be prevented?
- **Awareness/Training**: Who needs to be trained on mitigating similar incidents?
- **Data Security**: Does affected data require additional protection?
- **Information Protection & Procedures**: Do policies need updates?
- **Maintenance**: Should hardware/software be updated?
- **Protective Technology**: Should security tools (e.g., firewalls, IPS) be deployed?

### **3. Detect**
_Implement detection mechanisms for identifying threats and attacks._

- **Anomalies & Events**: Use SIEM or other tools to detect anomalies.
- **Security Continuous Monitoring**: Implement IT processes for real-time monitoring.
- **Detection Process**: Deploy tools like IDS to identify threats.

### **4. Respond**
_Develop response plans for security incidents._

- **Response Planning**: Establish incident response playbooks.
- **Communications**: Define notification protocols for IT staff and end users.
- **Analysis**: Outline forensic steps for analyzing attacks.
- **Mitigation**: Determine steps for isolating affected systems.
- **Improvements**: Continuously refine response strategies.

### **5. Recover**
_Plan and execute recovery processes to restore systems and operations._

- **Recovery Planning**: Define restoration procedures.
- **Improvements**: Enhance current recovery measures.
- **Communications**: Establish notification plans for stakeholders.

## Conclusion

The NIST CSF provides a proactive and reactive approach to cybersecurity, ensuring organizations can effectively manage risks, respond to incidents, and recover swiftly. Implementing these functions helps minimize security threats and enhances an organizationâ€™s resilience against cyberattacks.
